simple Ping-Of-Death attack 


when penetration testing my own network and pinging it, i stumbles upon an option in parrotISO-Security-MATE edition and that is ping -f now this command is f values, or your averge client view, it is a flood fdor pings, im not quite sure if this is exclusive to parrot OS but if it does not work for you then you know why, this attack is a automation really, but can attack the following IPV6 through IPV4 routers and servers, im not sure if it can attack web servers but feel free to try it 


ive been looking for a command like this for a while, this one is for sure powerful, while being an old method it sends 6,000-10,000 packets a second with the size of 500MB and above


TESTED ON,||||||| DEBIAN, PARROT4.11, SEC-MATE
